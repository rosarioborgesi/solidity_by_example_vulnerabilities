## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed
- Basic knowledge of Solidity and smart contracts

## 📚 Examples

### 🔓 Accessing Private Data Hack
**Location:** `src/accessingPrivateData/`

Demonstrates that "private" variables in Solidity are not truly private. All blockchain data is publicly readable through direct storage access.

- **Contract:** `Vault.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/accessingPrivateData/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding Solidity storage layout and how to read private data using `cast storage`

### 🔄 Reentrancy Attack
**Location:** `src/reentrancy/`

Demonstrates the infamous reentrancy vulnerability used in the 2016 DAO hack. Shows how malicious contracts can recursively call back into vulnerable contracts before state updates complete, draining funds.

- **Contracts:** `EtherStore.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/reentrancy/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, reentrancy guards, and why state should be updated before external calls

### 🔢 Arithmetic Overflow and Underflow
**Location:** `src/arithmeticOverflowAndUnderflow/`

Demonstrates integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in Solidity < 0.8.0. Shows how unchecked arithmetic can bypass security mechanisms like time locks, allowing immediate fund withdrawal.

- **Contracts:** `TimeLock.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/arithmeticOverflowAndUnderflow/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Why Solidity 0.8.0+ is crucial for security, understanding SafeMath, and the importance of checking arithmetic operations in legacy contracts

### ⚔️ Denial of Service Attack
**Location:** `src/denialOfService/`

Demonstrates how a malicious contract can permanently lock a legitimate contract by refusing to accept Ether refunds, rendering the entire system unusable.

- **Contracts:** `KingOfEther.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/denialOfService/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** The importance of the "pull over push" pattern and avoiding automatic fund transfers that can fail

### 🎭 Delegatecall Vulnerability
**Location:** `src/delegateCall/`

Demonstrates how mismatched storage layouts between contracts can be exploited to hijack ownership when using delegatecall, allowing an attacker to take control of a contract.

- **Contracts:** `Lib.sol`, `HackMe.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/delegateCall/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding delegatecall context, storage layout matching, and the dangers of delegatecalling to mutable addresses

### 🎣 Phishing with tx.origin
**Location:** `src/phishingWithTxOrigin/`

Demonstrates how using `tx.origin` for authentication creates a phishing vulnerability where attackers can trick users into calling malicious contracts that drain their wallets.

- **Contracts:** `Wallet.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/phishingWithTxOrigin/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** The critical difference between `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`, and why `tx.origin` should never be used for authentication

### 💣 Self Destruct Vulnerability
**Location:** `src/selfDestruct/`

Demonstrates how `selfdestruct` can be weaponized to force-send ETH to any contract, breaking game logic and business rules that rely on `address(this).balance` for critical decisions.

- **Contracts:** `EtherGame.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/selfDestruct/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Never rely on `address(this).balance` for critical logic; use internal accounting variables instead to prevent manipulation via forced ETH transfers

### 🎭 Hiding Malicious Code
**Location:** `src/hideMaliciousCode/`

Demonstrates how attackers can hide malicious code by exploiting Solidity's unchecked type casting. Any address can be cast to any contract type, allowing malicious contracts to masquerade as legitimate ones.

- **Contracts:** `Foo.sol`, `Bar.sol`, `Mal.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/hideMaliciousCode/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Solidity doesn't verify type casts at runtime; prefer creating contracts with `new` instead of accepting external addresses, and always make external contract addresses public for verification

### 🍯 Honeypot Trap
**Location:** `src/honeyPot/`

Demonstrates a honeypot - a deliberately vulnerable-looking contract that's actually a trap for attackers. The contract appears to have a reentrancy vulnerability, baiting hackers to exploit it, but secretly prevents the attack from succeeding and captures their funds.

- **Contracts:** `Bank.sol`, `HoneyPot.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/honeyPot/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding how type casting is unchecked, deployment parameters are hidden, and inner revert reasons are masked; demonstrating why thorough verification of external contracts is crucial before interaction

### 🏃 Front Running
**Location:** `src/frontRunning/`

Demonstrates how attackers can watch the mempool and front-run profitable transactions by submitting their own transaction with higher gas fees. Also shows the **commit-reveal scheme**, a cryptographic defense that prevents front-running by binding commitments to the sender's address.

- **Contracts:** `FrontRunning.sol` (vulnerable), `CommitReveal.sol` (secure)
- **Guide:** [README](src/frontRunning/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding mempool visibility, front-running attacks, and how commit-reveal schemes (two-phase submissions with hashed commitments) protect against transaction reordering attacks

### 🔁 Signature Replay Attack
**Location:** `src/signatureReplay/`

Demonstrates how signatures without proper replay protection can be reused multiple times to drain funds. Shows the vulnerability in off-chain signature schemes and meta-transactions, then demonstrates the secure implementation using nonce-based replay protection.

- **Contracts:** `SignatureReplay.sol` (vulnerable), `NoSignatureReplay.sol` (secure), `ECDSA.sol` (signature verification library)
- **Guide:** [README](src/signatureReplay/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding ECDSA signature recovery, the importance of nonces and contract address binding in signed messages, EIP-191 vs EIP-712, and how to implement secure multi-sig wallets with off-chain signatures for meta-transactions

### 📏 Bypass Contract Size Check
**Location:** `src/bypassContractSizeCheck/`

Demonstrates how the `extcodesize` check can be bypassed during contract construction. Contracts attempting to restrict access to EOAs only can be fooled because `extcodesize` returns 0 during a contract's constructor execution, before bytecode is stored on-chain.

- **Contracts:** `Target.sol`, `FailedAttack.sol`, `Hack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/bypassContractSizeCheck/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding that `extcodesize` returns 0 during contract construction, creating a timing window where contracts can masquerade as EOAs; demonstrating why address-type-based access control is unreliable

### 🔄 Deploy Different Contracts at Same Address
**Location:** `src/deployDifferentContractsAtTheSameAddress/`

Demonstrates a sophisticated attack combining CREATE2 and selfdestruct to deploy different contracts at the same address. An attacker can deploy a benign contract, get it approved by a DAO, destroy it, then redeploy malicious code at the same address to bypass the original approval.

- **Contracts:** `DAO.sol`, `Proposal.sol`, `Attack.sol`, `DeployerDeployer.sol`, `Deployer.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/deployDifferentContractsAtTheSameAddress/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding CREATE2 deterministic deployment, how selfdestruct enables address reuse, the dangers of approving addresses instead of code hashes, and why delegatecall to untrusted addresses is extremely dangerous

### 💰 Vault Inflation Attack
**Location:** `src/vaultInflationAttack/`

Demonstrates how vault share prices can be manipulated through direct token transfers (donations) to inflate the share value, causing subsequent depositors to receive zero shares due to integer division rounding. This allows an attacker to steal all deposited funds while victims lose their entire deposits.

- **Contracts:** `Vault.sol` (vulnerable ERC-4626-style vault)
- **Guide:** [README](src/vaultInflationAttack/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding ERC-4626 vault mechanics, share price calculation vulnerabilities, integer division rounding exploitation, front-running risks with first deposits, and critical prevention techniques including minimum shares, dead shares, internal balance tracking, and decimal offsets
