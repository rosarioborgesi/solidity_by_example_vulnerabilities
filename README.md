# Solidity Security Vulnerabilities - Foundry Implementation

This repository contains **security vulnerability examples** (hacks) from [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/), implemented and tested using **Foundry**.

## 📋 About

[Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/) provides educational content on common smart contract vulnerabilities. This repository recreates those vulnerability demonstrations using Foundry, allowing you to learn how these attacks work and how to prevent them in a hands-on environment.


## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed
- Basic knowledge of Solidity and smart contracts

## 📚 Examples

### 🔓 Accessing Private Data Hack
**Location:** `src/accessingPrivateData/`

Demonstrates that "private" variables in Solidity are not truly private. All blockchain data is publicly readable through direct storage access.

- **Contract:** `Vault.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/accessingPrivateData/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding Solidity storage layout and how to read private data using `cast storage`

### 🔄 Reentrancy Attack
**Location:** `src/reentrancy/`

Demonstrates the infamous reentrancy vulnerability used in the 2016 DAO hack. Shows how malicious contracts can recursively call back into vulnerable contracts before state updates complete, draining funds.

- **Contracts:** `EtherStore.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/reentrancy/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, reentrancy guards, and why state should be updated before external calls

### 🔢 Arithmetic Overflow and Underflow
**Location:** `src/arithmeticOverflowAndUnderflow/`

Demonstrates integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in Solidity < 0.8.0. Shows how unchecked arithmetic can bypass security mechanisms like time locks, allowing immediate fund withdrawal.

- **Contracts:** `TimeLock.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/arithmeticOverflowAndUnderflow/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Why Solidity 0.8.0+ is crucial for security, understanding SafeMath, and the importance of checking arithmetic operations in legacy contracts

### ⚔️ Denial of Service Attack
**Location:** `src/denialOfService/`

Demonstrates how a malicious contract can permanently lock a legitimate contract by refusing to accept Ether refunds, rendering the entire system unusable.

- **Contracts:** `KingOfEther.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/denialOfService/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** The importance of the "pull over push" pattern and avoiding automatic fund transfers that can fail

### 🎭 Delegatecall Vulnerability
**Location:** `src/delegateCall/`

Demonstrates how mismatched storage layouts between contracts can be exploited to hijack ownership when using delegatecall, allowing an attacker to take control of a contract.

- **Contracts:** `Lib.sol`, `HackMe.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/delegateCall/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding delegatecall context, storage layout matching, and the dangers of delegatecalling to mutable addresses

### 🎣 Phishing with tx.origin
**Location:** `src/phishingWithTxOrigin/`

Demonstrates how using `tx.origin` for authentication creates a phishing vulnerability where attackers can trick users into calling malicious contracts that drain their wallets.

- **Contracts:** `Wallet.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/phishingWithTxOrigin/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** The critical difference between `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`, and why `tx.origin` should never be used for authentication

### 💣 Self Destruct Vulnerability
**Location:** `src/selfDestruct/`

Demonstrates how `selfdestruct` can be weaponized to force-send ETH to any contract, breaking game logic and business rules that rely on `address(this).balance` for critical decisions.

- **Contracts:** `EtherGame.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/selfDestruct/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Never rely on `address(this).balance` for critical logic; use internal accounting variables instead to prevent manipulation via forced ETH transfers

### 🎭 Hiding Malicious Code
**Location:** `src/hideMaliciousCode/`

Demonstrates how attackers can hide malicious code by exploiting Solidity's unchecked type casting. Any address can be cast to any contract type, allowing malicious contracts to masquerade as legitimate ones.

- **Contracts:** `Foo.sol`, `Bar.sol`, `Mal.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/hideMaliciousCode/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Solidity doesn't verify type casts at runtime; prefer creating contracts with `new` instead of accepting external addresses, and always make external contract addresses public for verification

### 🍯 Honeypot Trap
**Location:** `src/honeyPot/`

Demonstrates a honeypot - a deliberately vulnerable-looking contract that's actually a trap for attackers. The contract appears to have a reentrancy vulnerability, baiting hackers to exploit it, but secretly prevents the attack from succeeding and captures their funds.

- **Contracts:** `Bank.sol`, `HoneyPot.sol`, `Attack.sol`
- **Guide:** [README](src/honeyPot/README.md)
- **Key Learning:** Understanding how type casting is unchecked, deployment parameters are hidden, and inner revert reasons are masked; demonstrating why thorough verification of external contracts is crucial before interaction
